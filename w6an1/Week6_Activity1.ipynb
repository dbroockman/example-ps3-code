    "- `ally`: The authors thought that social lobbying might be especially effective among legislators who had supported the group's priorities in the past. To measure this, they asked the lobbyist: \"In your opinion, how well does the phrase ‘ally of the interest group’ describe the legislator?\" This is therefore the lobbyists' rating of whether the legislator is an ally of the interest group (values 0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1).\n",
