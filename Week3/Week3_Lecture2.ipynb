Often times, evidence that could be consistent with a hypothesis could also be interpreted as _inconsistent_ with it due to _alternative explanations_. One of our most important jobs as critical consumers of data is to think of potential alternative explanations for an empirical pattern, since this helps us evaluate whether the empirical test is actually consistent with the hypothesis, or might not actually say much about it at all.\n",
